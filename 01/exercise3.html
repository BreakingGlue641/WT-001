        <p><b>Gear 5 ("Gear Fifth")</b> is the awakened form of the Gomu Gomu no Mi, which strengthens the user's rubbery body. It also allows the user the ability to manipulate and transform their environment, similar to a Paramecia's awakening.[2] Luffy achieved this ability during his final battle with Kaidou on Onigashima.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: right;"><i>Overview</i></h3>
        <p style="color: red;"><u>The awakening of the Gomu Gomu no Mi</u>, formerly known as the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, grants the user's rubber-like body increased strength and freedom, allowing them to fight in any way they please. It is for this reason that the user is said to become the "Warrior of Liberation" (解放の戦士, Kaihō no Senshi?), bringing joy and freedom to those around them,<small>and this fruit's power being described as "the most ridiculous power in the world" (世界で最もふざけた能力, sekai de mottomo fuzaketa nōryoku?)</small>.[4]</p>
